The purpose of the study is to predict driver’s injury level in a car crash using machine learning techniques. The data used for the analysis are the records of bodily injury accidents occurred between two cars in Metropolitan France in 2005-2017. The outcome variable is severity of the accident 
represented by four levels of injury: “no injury”, “light injury”, “hospitalised” and “killed”.


The code is to be run in the following order:
1. take "data" zip folder and copy to your local directory
2. extract files contained in "data" zip folder
3. take "subset" csv file and put in your local directory
4. open "project_preprocessing_data", change the importing and output directories to your own and run the code, it will import and preprocess dataset and then export the pre-processed dataset to your directory. Pre-processed dataset is also directly available in "subset_2class_agg" file.
5. open "project_EDA" file, change importing directory to your own and run the code, it will show Exploratory Data Analysis results
6. open "Models" file, change importing directory to your own and run the code, it will show Random Forest, SVM, KNN and XGBoost models results
7. open "CNN Models" file, change importing directory to your own and run the code, it will show CNN models results
